# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

Learned how to run, debug, and test my javascript code. This website can be run with live preview through VSCode. I am currently coding on windows, but should be the same in Mac OS or Linux in terms of execution, debugging, and running.

Reference for myself:

Using QUnit: test/test.html for debugging OR debugging through visual studio.

git add -A

git commit -m "Your message"

git push -u origin master
